		 <p>
		 Hello, my name is Rob Herd. I am 26-year , native to Atlanta, GA. I am married
		 to my beautiful and patient wife Alex Herd, and have two wonderfully noisy dogs named Goose and Duck. Goose is a Siberian
		 Husky, and Duck is a Mountain Cur/climbing dog. I currently work as a support analyst/developer at PowerPlan, Inc., which
		 develops financial software solutions for asset-intensive industries. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		 I went to school at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I studied Aerospace Engineering for 5 years before finally breaking
		 free and graduating. I have since gone on to other fields of work and study, including this class, where I hope to finally
		 learn the development skills that I use in my job everyday. Some of my hobbies outside of work/school include playing the piano,
		 fencing, playing tennis, and taking my dogs on roadtrips and adventures. I love cold brew coffee and tacos.
